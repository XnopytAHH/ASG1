                        <p>We had the joy of being able to perform in collaboration with NP Strings at their Art Series on the 13th of September 2024. We performed 2 songs, ‚ÄòHana no En‚Äô and ‚ÄòRainbow Overture‚Äô composed by Kengo Momose and Keigo Fujii respectively. We had a chance to incorporate our drum elements into these pieces by composing our parts to give colour to these pieces. ‚ú®üåà</p>

                        <p >We were provided with the opportunity to perform the opening piece for our own schools Go Global Fest event on the 8th of November. This event had our school showcasing the diverse cultures we see in our school, from Korean culture, Malay culture, Chinese culture and Japanese culture! We performed for the opening ceremony, playing a popular piece by world famous Taiko group, Kodo, called Haruka. This piece was a great way to start the event, as it was a friendly piece that showcased the community and the happy energy we can convey through Taiko drumming. üåçüéâ</p>

                        <p >It was an honor that we were able to perform at the sixth installment of World Drum Night, our biggest event of the year. World drum night took place at Republic Polytechnics Culture Center on the 2nd of November 2024. This event brought together drum groups from all over Singapore, from Zingo festival drums, POLITE groups like us and even some alumni groups, includng some of our alumni in the group Hatsu Ryo. We performed a piece that our members wrote by the name "Kinou no saki", a song conveying our togetherness and unity, as well as the legacy that we will leave for future generations of NP Taiko. Kinou no saki was also mixed with Haruka, written by Kodo, Reach out for the skies by Rui En and Taufik Batisah and Our Singapore by JJ Lin</p>
