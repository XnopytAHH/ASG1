# ASG1: NP Taiko Website
This project is a website promoting one of the CCA's in NP, NP Taiko. This website collates and displays information about the group for fans to see. 
## Design Process
The original idea stemmed from the fact that the group did not have and was actively looking for a website where they could collect their information for people to see. The website was made both for the group, so they could keep a catalog, as well as any people who have watched or heard of the group before. Through building a website with info on the group's performances, users would not need to navigate to seperate social media platforms, which may be quite inconvenient 

As a user, how might i find or see performances that i could not see in person?

The website includes not only behind the scenes photos but also recordings of the performances, in case any of it would want to be rewatched


As a user, I would like to be able to easily find the social media platforms of the group, so that i may see more of their work.

This is all collated in the website, as in the about us section the links to all the socials are included

The first draft was quite ambitious, and i could not figure out some of the elements on it in time, but the main layout is still there in the final version.
